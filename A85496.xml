            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

for thou ſeeſt that this Book (as part of
its Title) challengeth the Name of that
Learned, and Judicious Clerk, <hi>John Goulds<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough;</hi>
A Name ſo well known (even in
this our Age) that I ſhould but trifle away
time, in multiplying words, to tell thee what
he was, and to inlarge upon his worth; and
allſo diſcover (too much) mine own weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb facs="tcp:110883:3"/>
by endeavouring to prove ſo known a
Truth, that it is by all (allready) taken for
grantld. For the ſecond, I am aſſured, that
the Copy hath been communicated to the
view of many knowing men in the profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Common Law, whoſe unanimous
conſent in a fair Teſtimony of the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy

of the now making it publique, but allſo of
heigthning the Publiſhers hopes, that this
Book will be peruſed with as much content,
and received with as generall an Applauſe,
as any thing (of the like nature) that theſe
latter yeares have afforded; And that his
great care and hazard in this his Edition may
receive thy candid conſtruction, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
reap (if not a fruitfull) yet (at leaſt) a
ſaving return, for his better encouragement
to adventure further (hereafter) in this
kind, for thine, and the publique good.
For thy further ſatisfaction know, that thou
haſt not here a ſpurious deformed Brat, falſly
fathered upon the name of a dead man, too
<pb facs="tcp:110883:3"/>
too uſuall a trick, played by the ſubtile Game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters

preſented to thee, though I cannot ſay the
Iſſue of the Learned <hi>Gouldsborough</hi>'s own
Brain, yet I dare ſay, the Work of his own
Hand; and that, which were he living, he
would not bluſh to own. A Work, I ſay,
not roughly drawn, and caſt by, in neglected
Sheets, till time ſhould give leave for the
perfecting thereof, but carefully tranſcribed
(by himſelf) in a fair Manuſcript, deſtined
(as it ſhould ſeem) either for the Preſs and
publique view, or to be preſerved as a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
Jewell, to be (privately) made uſe of
in ſucceeding Ages. That this is true, there
want not many living Teſtimonies, of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of worth, who doe, and have very good
reaſon to know his Hand-writing, that, if
need required, might be produced, to ſay as
much. I ſhall adde but one thing more, and
that in brief is this, As the Authour was
very careful in Tranſcribing and Correcting

his Copy, that he might leave it fair, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire

                  <p>It ſeemeth that the Avowant ſhall have Return; and firſt I
will not ſpeak much to that which hath been agreed here before you,
that a Remainder may be charged well enough; for by the Statute
the Remainder is lawfully inveſted in <hi>Richard;</hi> and I agree well that
no Formdone in a Remainder was at the Common Law, and ſo are
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:110883:13"/>
our Bookes, in 8 <hi>Ed.</hi> 2. and <hi>Fitzh.</hi> in his <hi>Nat. brev.</hi> ſaith, that it is
given by the equity of the Statute. At the Common Law there was
no Formdone in diſcender, now it is given by the Statute of <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
2</hi> cap. 1. For in <hi>novo caſu erit novum remedium apponendum.</hi> And
I have taken it for Law, that when a thing is once lawfully veſted in
a man,<note place="margin">Lawful veſture.</note> it ſhall never be deveſted without a lawfull Recovery; and
here the Recovery doth not touch the Rent; and I think that all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the Remainder was never executed in poſſeſſion, yet the
Grantee of the Rent ſhall confeſs and avoyd it well enough. The
Fine is not pleaded here with proclamation, and therefore it is but a
bare diſcontinuance, in proof whereof is the caſe in 4 of <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
in tayl makes a diſcontinuance,<note place="margin">Diſtreſs per grantee, before entrie of the grantor.</note> yet he in Reverſion may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrein
for his ſervice. And if there be Tenant for life, the Reverſion
to a ſtranger, and he in Reverſion grant a Rent charge, Tenant for
life is diſſeiſed and dye, the Grantee of the Rent ſhall diſtrein, all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
that he in Reverſion will never enter: And ſo if Tenant in
tayl, the Remainder to the right heirs of <hi>I. S.</hi> make a Feoffment in
Fee upon the death of the Tenant in tayl without iſſue,<note place="margin">Droit heir de I. S.</note> the right heir
of <hi>I. S.</hi> ſhall enter well enough: And he put <hi>Pleſingtons</hi> caſe in 6 <hi>R.

Which caſes prove, that allthough the eſtate whereupon the grant is be
in ſuſpence when the grant ought to take effect, yet the grant ſhall take
effect well enough; and if Tenant in tayl, and he in remainder had
joyned, this had been good clearly. And 8 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. &amp; 43 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. Tenant

dyed without iſſue, I think the Lord (in this caſe) ſhall diſtrein for
the ſervice, then I ſuppoſe that the fine in the principall caſe ſhall
not exclude the Grantee from his rent; for there is a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween

which the rent is iſſuing is gone, the rent is allſo gone; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let us ſee what authority Tenant in tayl hath in the remainder.
At the Common Law, there was no Formdone in deſcender or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder;
and the Statute of <hi>W. 2. cap.</hi> 1. provides but for two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
<hi>viz.</hi> he in reverſion and the iſſues; but Formdone in remainder
is taken by the equity. 50 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. If Tenant for life be, the remainder

bargain his remainder that it is voyd, and he cannot grant to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that he ſhall dig in the ſoyl, for by 2 <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. he in reverſion can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
doe ſo. 12 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. Recovery ſuffered ſhall bind the iſſue. 7 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3.
no attaint lieth for him in remainder of a verdict given againſt Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
for life,<note place="margin">Nul attaint pur tenant in rem.</note> then in this caſe he in remainder cannot enter, and the
Grantee ſhall not be in a better eſtate than his Grantor, and then if
he ſhall never enter, <hi>fruſtra est illa potentia qua nunquam reducitur in
actum.</hi> The reaſon for the grant is good; for when Tenant in tayl
dyeth without iſſue, he in remainder ſhall be in by the firſt gift
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:110883:14"/>
in proof whereof is 33 <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. he in remainder ſhall be in ward;<note place="margin">Ward.</note> and
in 11 <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. in Formdone in deſcender,<note place="margin">Formdone.</note> he ſhall ſay that the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion

induction.<note place="margin">Ioyntenants.</note> But if two Jointenants be, and the one charge all, and
the other diſclaimeth, the charge is good from the beginning: And
the Recoverer here is not under the charge; for allthough he hath
that eſtate which he in remainder ſhould have if Tenant in tayl had
not aliened, yet is he a meer ſtranger, and in by another title, 10 <hi>Ed.
3.</hi> If two Jointenants be,<note place="margin">Charge per Ioyntenant.</note> and the one charge, this is good, conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
that he which chargeth ſhall ſurvive. And if Tenant <hi>pur auter
vie</hi> charge and die, <hi>occupans</hi> ſhall hold it diſcharged: So in this
caſe; for he is not in of this poſſeſſion. Moreover, there is a miſchief
if this charge be good; for then the Land may be charged by two ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
perſons at once, which ſhall not be ſuffered; but yet if <hi>ceſtui
que uſe</hi> charge, and the Feoffees charge, both are good, for the one
is by the Common Law,<note place="margin">Charge per ceſt. que uſe &amp; Feoffees.</note> 28 <hi>Ed. 3. 10. b.</hi> and the other by the Statute
Law. So if Leſſee for years charge, and he in reverſion charge, and
after Leſſee for years ſurrender; but this is in ſeverall reſpects, and
I put this caſe for Law,<note place="margin">Ch. per leſſee, &amp; per enreverſion.</note> that if he in the remainder bind himſelf in

this caſe he will grant the rent over, none ought to Attorn, and
therefore voyd; and <hi>Littleton</hi> ſaith, that he in remainder ſhall not
falſifie;<note place="margin">No attornment. Falſifying.</note> and 26 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. the Grantee of leſſee for years ſhall not falſifie;
for the nature of falſifying is properly to find a fault, wherefore it

                        </gap>nis conditionalibus,</hi> a Fine levyed was

as I intend, the Law was ſuch, that when Tenant in tayl levied a Fine
of ſuch a thing as he might diſcontinue, and the Fine executed in
poſſeſſion, allthough the words of the Statute were <hi>Ipſo jure ſit nullus,</hi>
yet the iſſue was put to his Formdone; but if it were a Fine Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,
then by the death of the Tenant in tayl the iſſue was remitted,
and the Fine voyd: But now by the Statute of 4 <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. the Law is
made otherwiſe; and for that here it is to be granted, that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
diſcontinue the eſtate tayl, becauſe the reverſion is in the King,
as it was now lately adjudged in the Exchequer in the caſe of <hi>Gille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brand,
ergo,</hi> here the eſtate doth not paſs to the Feoffees by the firſt
Fine, when he took an eſtate again to himſelf for life, the remainder
to the Lord <hi>Seymer</hi> in Fee, but a Fee ſimple determinable, then when
the Lord <hi>Seymer</hi> was attainted, Queen <hi>Mary</hi> had ſuch an eſtate as
the Lord <hi>Seymer</hi> had, which was a Fee determinable, and ſhe had
another Fee abſolute in <hi>jure Coronae:</hi> After when he ſued by Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:110883:15"/>
he did not ſhew to the Queen what eſtate he had, nor what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate
the Queen had, but that it was to the diſinheriſion of him and
his heirs; then the Queen grants <hi>reverſionem inde adeo plene libere
&amp; integre</hi> as ſhe had it, or as it came to her by the Act of Parliament.
And I think when the Queen gives by generall words, ſhe doth not
give any ſpecial Prerogative: And for that 8 <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. fol. 2. A grant

Queen <hi>Mary</hi> grants in <hi>Manerium de Bedminſter in Com. Somerſet, 5. 13

&amp;c.</hi> and this will not make any grant of the reverſion. For the
meaning of the Queen was, becauſe <hi>Bainton</hi> had no recompenſe of

of <hi>Seymer,</hi> as it is agreed 1 <hi>Maria</hi> fol. 96. ſo nothing paſſed

neither is he bound by the Statute of 4 <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. for the Statute

by the Fine all are gone and paſſed to the Coniſee; for if he

and he had never entred, and therefore it was but as a common, or
a rent; but if it be a leaſe in poſſeſſion, he is bound, as in <hi>Zouches</hi>
caſe. Then becauſe the King is in poſſeſſion, it hath been ſayd that
it is no bar; but this ſeemeth to be no reaſon; for the Statute began
with the King, and the Preamble ſeemeth to induce it; and the
third, ſaving of the Statute, is by force of any gift in tayl, ſo this
is generall: And becauſe he cannot diſcontinue, therefore can he not
make a bar? <hi>Non ſequitur:</hi> For he cannot diſcontinue, and yet a
Fine levyed is a good bar; and the Statute of 32 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. doth not
impair this opinion, but it was to take away the doubt moved in
29 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. Allthough indeed the Law was all wayes clear in the caſe,
as it was agreed by all the Judges in <hi>Stowels</hi> caſe; and the words
of the Statute of 34 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. that the recoveries ſhall be no bar, doth
not extend but to the words going before, as in the caſe in <hi>Dyer,</hi>
that a man had not done any act but that, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the Queen in this
caſe hath not any prejudice; for ſhe ſhall have the rent with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion:
And as for <hi>Jacksons</hi> caſe; that maketh for me; for the
queſtion of the caſe there was, that the remainder ſhall be gone, and
we ought not to take regard to that which is ſayd indirectly in the

<hi>viz.</hi> That the Jury find that 37 ſ. of the rent was behind, and doe not
ſay expreſly, for the houſe which is now in queſtion, I hold that a vain
exception; for when they have found that more was behind than that

which was now in queſtion, allthough that it be in generality, yet
it is good for the particularity; and for that matter I could remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

if a man be bound in a Statute Merchant, and after the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſor

think, remains in him ſtill; for in 31 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. an advowſon deſcended

granted it to Queen <hi>Philip</hi> his Wife,<note place="margin">Advoſon to 3 parceners.</note> and ſhe granted it over to the

was poſſeſſed of the wardſhip of the youngeſt, he was intitled to

hath been ſayd, that the condition is a proviſo, I deny that; for a
proviſo,<note place="margin">Proviſio quid ſit</note> as me ſeemeth, either is in the affirmative, that a thing ſhall
be done; or in the negative, that it ſhall not be done; but here it is
neither directly affirmative, nor negative, and therefore they have

this as it ſeemeth they cannot doe, becauſe it is a thing in another
County; eſpecially they being but an Inqueſt of Office. Further, they
have found that 37 ſ. was behind at one Feaſt, and this is impoſſible;
for then the entire rent ſhould amount to 7 l. And further, the Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors
have purchaſed the reverſion, before the return of the Inquiſition
and Commiſſion, and then the Queen cannot be intitled, becauſe ſhe
hath not the Freehold; for it hath been adjudged here, that if a man
fell his lands, and afterwards makes livery thereof, and after inrolls

it takes effect by the livery which was before the inrolment: And <hi>8.

in proof whereof both great reaſon and authority is
copious: For if the Leſſor had entred into parcel, this

and it was adjudged that he ſhall not take advantage by the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
for when he took an eſtate back again, the rent was ſuſpended,
and then for the ſum in groſs he ſhall not re-enter, becauſe the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

                     </note> and after they make partition (as they
well may, having the reverſion and the freehold in them) I hold the

                     </gap> demand,
I agree well thereto; the reaſon is, becauſe the demand is a thing
which goeth to the perſon of the King. Then, Sir, the Statute is, that
the King ſhall have it as the Prior had it, which is meant of the eſtate
and not of the perſon of the King: Then, Sir, it is impoſſible that
the King ſhould have the land as the Prior had it, <hi>ut in priſtino statu
ſuo,</hi> if he doe not utterly defeat the grant made to <hi>Cordall;</hi> then here
the condition is gone,<note place="margin">The Kings grant againſt the Law is voyd.</note> but not by any grant as it hath been moved,
but by the operation of the Law: And 49 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. the King grants that
lands ſhall be deviſable, it is voyd, becauſe it is againſt the Law; and it
is againſt the Law, that a condition ſhould be apportioned, <hi>ergo,</hi> the
King ſhall not apportion it. But admit this queſtion againſt me, then
let us ſee what title the Queen hath by this commiſſion. Firſt, the
commiſſion is to enquire if <hi>Cordall</hi> his Aſſigns and Farmers have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
all covenants and proviſoes contained in the Indenture;<note place="margin">Proviſo.</note> as
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:110883:21"/>
for that I hold the law clear that they have au<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hority, by thoſe words,
to enquire of the condicion, but for other reaſons I think the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
void. For the Commiſſion is to enquire <hi>per bonos &amp; legales ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines

were of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> and therefore the inquiſition is not good.
Further,<note place="margin">Severall &amp; ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecial finding.</note> they have found a thing in another County, and this they
cannot find, but I hold that the Jury in one County, may find the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
iſſue in another County. Allſo I hold that when the party can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
plead that which is the great matter of the Action, they may
find it in an another County becauſe the party cannot pleade it, as
in 9 <hi>Ed.</hi> 2. in debt againſt Executors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And for theſe reaſons I

                  <p>So it
was here rul'd five years ago in <hi>Nowells</hi> caſe, and thereupon
<hi>Puckering</hi> gave evidence for the Tenant, that it was Parcell of the
Mannor of <hi>Sarrot,</hi> which Mannor the Tenant hath, and this was gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the Counſell of the Defendant. And in concluſion upon the
evidence given, the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Defendant would have had the Tenant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to have
Demurred upon his evidence, and diſcharge the Inqueſt, but the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
would not; in effect this was the doubt. <hi>K. H.</hi> 8. by his Letters
Patents, gave among other things, all the Lands which were in the
Tenure of one <hi>Whyton,</hi> and demiſed to <hi>Johnſon</hi> in the Pariſh of

but not demiſed to <hi>Johnſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi>
                     <note place="margin">Miſre-citall.</note> and allſo they were not in the Pariſh
of <hi>Watford;</hi> if this ſhall be helped by the Statute of Miſrecitall, and
not Recitall, is the queſtion, and the party did not aver that the intent
of the King was to paſs this Parcell now in queſtion to the Patentee,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:110883:22"/>
and the opinion of all the Court, was, that it is not within the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
clearly, but they ſaid to the Jury, that they may find all this
matter if they will, or otherwiſe ſay what they will. And thereupon
after they were agreed, they came again to the Bar, and then all the
Court told them, that yet they might give a ſpeciall Verdict. The
Jury ſaid we are all agreed that the Tenant hath more right to hold
theſe Lands as he now holdeth, then the Demandant as he demands
them.</p>

for me, for the reaſon wherefore he ſhall be barred is, becauſe the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
goeth according to the Eſtate which the Wife had, and
then it is reaſon that he ſhall be barred, but in the ſame caſe, if the
Husband ſurvive, it is ſaid in the ſame Book, that the Iſſue ſhall be

               <p>A <hi>Quare impedit</hi> was brought by <hi>Specot</hi> and his wife againſt the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of <hi>Exeter,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Paſch. 28 El. rot. 2091.</note> and declared how <hi>A. F.</hi> was ſeiſed of the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
to which the Advowſon is appendant, and preſented, and deviſed
the Mannor to his wife now one of the Plaintifs, and ſhe after took
to husband <hi>Specot,</hi> and then the Church became voyd, and they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
their<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Clerk, and the Biſhop diſturbed them. The Biſhop
pleaded that he claims nothing but as Ordinary, and that the Church
is with cure of ſoules, and confeſſeth the title of the Plaintif: And
that they preſented, but he alleged in bar, that he examined their
Clerk, and upon the examination, <hi>Invenit eum fore ſchiſmaticum in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veteratum,</hi>
ſo that by the Law of holy Church he could not admit
him. Whereupon the Plaintif demurred in Law.</p>

                  <p>The Plaintif ought to recover.<note place="margin">Certainty.</note> Firſt, I agree, that if it had been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged in certain wherein he had been a Schiſmatick, this had been a ſufficient plea to excuſe him, but as this is, it is otherwiſe. For a
Schiſmatick is he which divides and ſeparates himſelf from the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
and the Faith eſtabliſhed.<note place="margin">Schiſmatick.</note> But this plea is inſufficient for the uncertainty, and therefore in 38 <hi>H.</hi> 3. fol. 2. <hi>Fitzh. Quare imped.</hi> 124. The Earl of <hi>Arundell</hi> brought a <hi>Quare impedit,</hi> and the other ſayd,
that he preſented one to him who was perjured for certain cauſes,<note place="margin">Perjury.</note>
and ſhewed for what, whereby he was not a perſon capable, and ſo
it ſhould be in this caſe; and in 12 <hi>Eliz. Dyer</hi> fol. 293. he ought to
ſet down the diſability of the Clerk,<note place="margin">Notice of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability certain.</note> and give notice to the Patron.
And allſo in <hi>Dyer 9 Eliz.</hi> fol. 254. the Biſhop refuſed the Clerk becauſe
he was a haunter of Taverns and unlawfull<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Games,<note place="margin">Tavern and gaming.</note> 
                     <hi>&amp;c. Et ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

diverſa alia criminafuit criminoſus &amp; inhabilis, &amp;c.</hi> And there the
Plea was thought not good,<note place="margin">Evil in it ſelf.</note> becauſe that the faults alleged were not
evill in their own nature,<note place="margin">Evil forbidden.</note> but by the prohibition of the Law. And
allſo the Plea was naught, becauſe he had not ſhewed what the other
faults were. And the reaſon wherefore the Ordinary ought certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to allege what faults the Preſentee hath, is, becauſe the Patron
may preſent another unto him, who is not infected with the ſame
faults, and how can the Patron tell that his Clerk is diſabled for
ſuch a fault, when he doth not know certainly what the fault is?
Then if the Plea of the Ordinary be inſufficient, whether he ſhall be
a diſturber by his evill Plea,<note place="margin">Diſturber by evil pleading. Triall.</note> and it ſeemeth that he ſhall; for ſo is
the Book in 14 <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. fol. 21 <hi>b.</hi> &amp;. <hi>5. Hen. 7. 20.<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> Allſo for another
reaſon the Plea is not good, for it is too general for the trial; and all
though that it may be ſayd that it ſhall not be tryed by a Jury, but by
the Metropolitan, as perchance it ſhall be, yet it is too generall; for
how can he know wherein he is a Schiſmatick,<note place="margin">Raviſhment of a Ward.</note> ſo that he may exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
him thereof? as in Raviſhment of Ward, ſuppoſing that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant

good, becauſe he did not ſhew in certain how ſhe was heir to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
<note place="margin">Coment. f. 42. b.</note> and ſo I think the Plaintif ought to recover.</p>

                  <p>to the
contrary: And it ſeemeth the Plaintif ſhall be barred; Firſt, when
a Parſon is preſented to the Biſhop it appears fully that the exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of him appertains fully to the Biſhop,<note place="margin">Examination.</note> as it is expreſſed in
the Statute <hi>De Articulis Clers, de ideoneitate perſonae preſent at ae ad be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficium

Parſon is the cure of the Ordinary, as it is expreſſed in 32 <hi>Hen.</hi> 6.
He ſhall ſay to him, <hi>Accipe curam tuam, &amp; curam meam.</hi> Then if
we ſhall be driven to ſhew wherein he is a Schiſmatick, and I think
not; for the Book of 38 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. fol. 2. which is vouched againſt me, is
with me;<note place="margin">Perjury.</note> for there he ſhewed before what Judge he was perjured,
which is very neceſſary; for if it be not before a Judge it is no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury;
but there he did not ſhew wherein he was perjured: Allſo he
ſayd, that in 12 <hi>Eliz.</hi> in the Biſhop of <hi>Norwich</hi>'s caſe, the opinion of
<hi>Walſh,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Manners, Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, difference.</note> that thoſe things which touch the manners of the Clerk, ſhall
be tryed by the Temporall Court, but that which toucheth the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or ſufficiency of the Clerk, ſhall be tryed by the Spirituall
Court. And in vain it ſhall be to allege wherein he is a Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick;
for this Court cannot judge of it, in proof whereof he cited
the Statute of 2 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8.<note place="margin">Schiſm.</note> And he defined a Schiſm to be <hi>Recens diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio
congregationis jure aliquo,</hi> but an Heretick is he which hath a habit
therein,<note place="margin">Heretick.</note> and is invetorate; ſo he concluded, that <hi>Schiſmaticus inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teratus
eſt Haereticus, &amp; Haereticus eſt Schiſmaticus inveteratus;</hi> and
he defined <hi>inveteratus</hi> to be, <hi>qui eſt multi &amp; veteris uſus in malitia.</hi>
And if the Biſhop had ſayd that he was an Heretick, he ſhould not
need to ſhew wherein, and for that he cited the caſe in 9 <hi>Edw. 4. 24.
Bro. Depoſition</hi> 5.<note place="margin">Depoſition.</note> Where a Depoſition of <hi>A.</hi> was pleaded, there he
ought to ſhew before what Judges he was depoſed, but not wherein.
And what is the reaſon that he muſt ſhew before what Judge it was?
Surely, becauſe this Court may know to what Court to write; and
allſo the caſe in 11 <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. fol. 8. <hi>Bro.</hi> 9. of the Union of <hi>Wamborough,</hi>
where it is pleaded, that <hi>concurrentibus hiis, &amp;c.</hi> and allſo he cited
8 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 24. where a divorce was pleaded, <hi>cauſa conſanguinitatis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ut
patet in recordo,</hi> and yet well: And allſo he cited the opinions of
<hi>Fitzherbert</hi> and <hi>Shelley, 27 Hen.</hi> 8. 14. that an Action upon the caſe
doth not lye at the Common Law,<note place="margin">Heretick.</note> for calling one Heretick, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Judges at the Common Law cannot diſcuſs it, and he
granted the caſes put by <hi>Shuttelworth,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matter iſſuable.</note> that where the matter is iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
there it ought to be certain, but not as this caſe is where it ſhall
not be tryed by a Jury; And that which hath been ſayd, that the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:110883:28"/>
Archbiſhop cannot examine him, becauſe he knoweth not wherein
he was a Schiſmatick; this is not ſo, for the Biſhop which accuſeth
him may inform the Archbiſhop, ſo that he may be well adviſed
thereof, and ſo I think judgment ſhall be given againſt the Plaintif.</p>

after ſhe granted a Copyhold, and if this be good was the queſtion;

the opinion of all the Court clearly was againſt the Grant; for when

                  <p>It ſeemeth that Judgement ſhall be given for the
Plaintif, becauſe it was not diſcharged at the time of the Feoffment.
For in the Commentaries a man Deviſeth his Term to his Wife until
his Son come to full age,<note place="margin">Com. fo. 539.</note> after at his full age the Son ſhall have it, ſo
that there it was chargable to the Entry of the Son hereafter. And
here allthough that it be not preſently charged, yet when there is a
charge ariſe, the Covenant is broken. And for that in 8 <hi>Eliz.</hi> a man
bargains and ſells Land,<note place="margin">Rent charge future.</note> and Covenants that it ſhall be diſcharged
of all charges, and he had granted a Rent before to begin twenty
years after, when the Rent begins it ſhall be ſaid a breach. And this
is not like the caſe in 3 <hi>Hen. 7. 12. b.</hi> Where Tenant in Tayl diſſeiſeth

by the grant end ſale, and then the Feoffment void, and therefore
no charge, and thereupon no charge at the time of the Feoffment, and
for that he cited 42 <hi>Ed. 3. &amp; 11 Hen.</hi> 7. 20. where Tenant in Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er

                  <p>The freſh ſuit mentioned in the Statute, ought to
be made by the Inhabitants, and not by the parties, and I am of your
opinion, that Hue and cry was at the Common Law, but what of
that? But look the Statute, and there is no word of Hue and cry.
And the Statute of 28 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. is an expoſition of that Statute, and there
is no mention thereof, but Freſh ſuit is there mentioned, which ought
to be made by the Inhabitants. And by thoſe Statutes it ſeemeth clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that the Inhabitants ought to guard the Country in ſuch ſort, as
men may ſafely travell without robbing. And for the night, Sir, wee
ought to conſtrue it, as it is moſt reaſonable, and about the ſetting of
the Sun is the common time of robbing, and therefore if this ſhall
not be intended by the Statute, nothing ſhall be intended; and all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the walled Towns cannot perſue,<note place="margin">Walled Towns may keep the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> waies.</note> yet they may keep the waies
ſo, that no robberies ſhall be committed, and this is both day and
night as I think. And if a man be ſlain in the robbery ſo that no Hue

the robbery,<note place="margin">A man is rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed ſlain and bound.</note> and ſo if he be bound: And if Hue and Cry ought to be,
when ought it to be? For if a man be bound two dayes together, he

                  <hi>WAlmiſley</hi> moved for Judgement in the caſe of <hi>Richard Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington</hi>
for the Plaintif. For he ſayd that it was not clearly

the charge were not then preſently executed; in proof whereof, he
ſayd that it is not all gone by the acceptance of the Feoffment, and
then it is a bargain, for a Leaſe for years is a bargain; for there he
hath <hi>quid pro quo.</hi> Allſo it is a Title, as in <hi>Nichols</hi> caſe in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries:
And then allthough he had nothing which he could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe,
becauſe it was caſuall whether it ſhall happen or no, yet now
when it happens it is a charge <hi>ab initio,</hi> and thereupon he cited 9 <hi>H.
6.</hi> where one which had nothing but a poſſibility may maintain.
And ſo where a man makes a Feoffment, and covenants that it ſhall
be diſcharged, as here; and afterwards his Wife recovers her Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
the Covenant is broken, and yet it was but a poſſibility. And <hi>8
Eliz.</hi> where a man covenants that it ſhall be diſcharged, and he had
granted a Rent charge to begin twenty years after, this was not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged.
<hi>Fenner</hi> argued to the contrary for the reaſons moved by

againſt the Plaintif.</p>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Windham</speaker>
                  <p>I am of the ſame opinion, and it ſeemeth that their difference and diſagreement in the limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the cauſe that both the limitations are void. Firſt let us
ſee who hath auctority to limit the uſe? ſurely the principall owner of the land hath the principall auctority to limit the uſe, and here the Wife is the principall owner,<note place="margin">What a uſe is.</note> and therefore hath chief
power to diſpoſe of the uſe; And, Sr. the uſe is the chief profit and
commodity of the land, and cannot be ſevered from the land, no
more than the ſhadow from the body, and this was the reaſon of
the Statute of <hi>27. H.</hi> 8. which draweth the poſſeſſion to the uſe, and not
the uſe to the poſſeſſion, for the uſe is the principall, for by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
law by bargain &amp; ſale enrolled the land ſhall paſs without livery,<note place="margin">Bargain and ſale.</note>
for this was a contract for the uſe, and then the law ſhall make the
land to paſs,<note place="margin">The Law erects. the uſe.</note> and whitherſoever the uſe is now carried, the land
and poſſeſſion ſhall follow, but when the Law carrieth the uſe, it
is to the owner and proprietary of the Land.<note place="margin">The mothers heir.</note> For if a man ſeiſed
of Lands on the part of his Mother, levy a fine thereof, the uſe ſhall
paſs according as the land ſhall, becauſe the law carrieth the uſe.
And here the Wife cannot limit the uſe without her Husband, and
therefore that is void, but yet it is good to this intent, to ſhew
her diſagreement.<note place="margin">Silence Conſent</note> And if the Husband limit the uſe, and ſhe doth
not diſagree, the law intendeth that ſhe conſenteth thereunto, becauſe
ſhe hath joined in the fine.<note place="margin">Sale in London by Husband and Wife.</note> And therefore in London, ſale of the lands
of the Wife by deed enrolled by the Husband only is good if ſhe
aſſent, or if ſhe do not diſagree. And although that ſhe ſhall not be
examined concerning the uſe, yet the Law will not have her defrau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of her land by joyning in the fine, without her conſent to the
uſe; for by that meanes every Wife may be defrauded of her land
by joyning in a fine, which were a great inconvenience, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to this ground in Law, that the Husband cannot diſpoſe of
the Wifes lands without her conſent. And although that if the
Wife had not ſhewed her agreement or diſagreement, then it ſhould
have been to the uſe limitted by the Husband, yet here ſhe hath
ſhewed an expreſs diſaſſent, and ſo by their variance, both their
declarations are void,<note place="margin">Quare impedit.</note> as in a <hi>Quare impedit</hi> by two, if both make ſeverall titles, both ſhallbe barred, and ſo judgment ſhallbe given againſt the Plaintif.<note place="margin">No <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note>

                  <speaker>Peryam</speaker>
                  <p>to the ſame intent. Firſt it is a plain
caſe that if a Husband and Wife levie a fine and limit no uſe, then
the uſe is to them as the land was before,<note place="margin">
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe what it is.</note> for the uſe is the profit of the land, and the Wife alone cannot limit the uſe, for du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the coverture ſhe hath ſubmitted her will to the will of her
Husband.<note place="margin">Silence.</note> And if they both levie a fine, and he onely by Indenture
limits uſes,<note place="margin">Limitation af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fine.</note> if ſhe do nothing, then his limitation is good, and the
caſe of <hi>Vaviſour</hi> adjudged here that a limitation after the fine is
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:110883:45"/>
good. And here the Husband hath limited the uſe to himſelf
for life;<note place="margin">Who ſhall limit uſes.</note> and afterwards they both agree in the limitation, now if
the reſidue in which they agree ſhall be good? I will ſhew my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
therein likewiſe, becauſe that alſo may come in queſtion here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.
And I think that this ſhall not bind the inheritance, for it is
a ground in Law, that limiters of uſes ſhallbe ſuch as have power
intereſt and auctority of the land, and no further; As if Tenant for
life and he in reverſion joyn in a fine,<note place="margin">Fine.</note> Tenant for life ſhall limit
but for his life, but here by the death of the Wife the ability of
the Husband is gone, for he had no iſſue by her, and therefore
his uſe ſhall bee gone allſo, for otherwiſe it ſhould be a
great inconvenience; but if they had joyned in the limitation,
then the inheritance of the Wife had been bound,<note place="margin">Inheritance. ſhall be bound by agreement.</note> and ſo it is if the
Law can intend that ſhe had agreed; And to ſay that the Coniſees
ſhall take it from the Husband and Wife, and therefore the Wife
to be concluded, is but ſmall reaſon, for ſhe may confeſſe the Record
well enough, as appeareth by the caſe of <hi>Eare</hi> and <hi>Snow</hi> in the Com. and no man can limit uſes further than he hath the land, and
here the limitation for the inheritance after the death of the wife
cannot be good, and for their variance both are void. And ſo I
think judgment ſhallbe given againſt the Plaintif. <hi>Rodes</hi> to the
ſame intent, for the Jury hath found that the Wife did not agree,
and this ſpeciall finding ſhall avoid all other common intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
<note place="margin">Intendment.</note> And the intendment of the party ſhall overthrow the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendment
of the Law, and he cited <hi>Eare</hi> and <hi>Snowes</hi> caſe, where it
was found that the wife had nothing. And he cannot limit uſes
farther than he hath eſtate in the land, and therefore judgment ſhall
be given againſt the Plaintif.</p>

neceſſity to be ſo curious in the conſideration; for that is not tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſable.
<note place="margin">Conſideration executory tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſable.</note> But <hi>Cook</hi> ſayd, that if it be Executory, then it is traverſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>Another Error <hi>Cook</hi> aſſigned, becauſe they had not alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
a not performance in the Father; for the promiſe of the
Father was to make a Feoffment to the uſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and they averre that
allthough that he did not make a gift in tayl, which cannot be the
ſame thing which the Father ſhould doe; for an eſtate to uſe in tayl,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:110883:57"/>
and a gift in tayl is not all one. But the Juſtices held it good, for by
the Statute of 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8. the uſe is executed, and ſo the eſtate executed.
Alſo the Declaration was that he had not made a gift in tayl <hi>ſecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum
agreamentum praedictum.</hi> But <hi>Cook</hi> moved that it ſhould not be
good, for if a man be bound to make an eſtate to another in the <hi>per,</hi>
and he make it in the <hi>poſt,</hi> this is no performance, and here by the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
he is in, in the <hi>post,</hi> and the not performance is alleged to
be, becauſe he did it not in the <hi>per,</hi> and ſaith, that he which is in by the
Statute, ſhall not vouch, for he is in, in the <hi>poſt,</hi> and he cited <hi>Winters</hi>
caſe, which was not denyed; but <hi>Peryam</hi> ſaid, that conſiderations in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions

                  <hi>John Kipping</hi> being a Copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder,
deviſed it to his Wife for life, the Remainder to <hi>VVilliam</hi>

it is not like to the caſe of deſcent, where the reverſion ſhould have
deſcended, for in this caſe <hi>VVilliam</hi> cannot Surrender before admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,

when it is by purchaſe then that cannot be ſurrendred, whereof ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance
ought to be,<note place="margin">Meſeu.</note> becauſe the Lord ought to have a fine of him, &amp;
therefore he likened it to the caſe in 18 <hi>E.</hi> 4. where the Meſne graunts
the Meſnality for life, the remainder in fee, and the Tenant attornes
to the Tenant for life, if he had cauſe of acquittance againſt the

if this ſhall be good to him in remainder then is the Lord without

the contrary; for the Remainder veſted when the particular eſtate

will conſent, in this caſe if the Husband onely conſent, it is not
ſufficient, but the Wife ought to aſſent allſo. And if this Will ſhall be
good, then this miſchief will enſue, that after a Will is once made,

                  <p>I am of the ſame opinion. For a Will
is not perfect untill after the death of the Deviſor,<note place="margin">No countermand</note> and when ſhe is
diſabled at the time of her death, the Law ſaith, that ſuch a Will is
void. But I think that a Feme-Covert cannot Countermand her
Will, for the ſame reaſon which doth diſable her to make a Will,
doth allſo diſable her to Countermand that which is made before;
for by 3 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3.<note place="margin">Conſummation.</note> which was cited before, ſhe cannot deviſe to her
Husband, and by the ſame reaſon ſhe cannot Countermand that which
is deviſed to her Husband; but becauſe the Wife was not a perſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

good.<note place="margin">Mar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that this is a Countermand, but if that it be a Reverſion after Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant

take effect at the time of the death, and if then ſhe be diſabled, it is
not good; for it is not conſummate before; as if there be Husband and

                     </gap>hit is but a Covenant, and no Condition. For in all caſes where this word (Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſo) ought to make a Condition, there ought to be a perfect ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
to explain the meaning of the parties, or otherwiſe it is no Condition. As if the wordes are provided allwaies that if the Rent be behind, and ſay no more now, this is no Condition
And here all the ſenſe comes in after the words of Covenant,
and theſe words are the words of Sir <hi>M. B.</hi> And for that it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
no Condition; for if the words had been, And it is provided by
Sir <hi>M. B.</hi> there it is clear no Condition. But if in a Leaſe for yeares
be words, and the Leſſee do provide, that if the Rent be behind,
that then the Leſſor ſhall re-enter, there I agree that this makes a
Conditon. And in the caſe put by my Brother <hi>Williams,</hi> a Leaſe
made, <hi>&amp; proviſum eſt quod non licebit</hi> to the Leſſor, to grant over up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on pain of forfeiture, there is a good Condition; But otherwiſe it

<hi>Clinch</hi> ſeemed that it is no Conditon, for the words may not

Proviſo ſhall be ſometimes taken for a Condition, and ſometimes
for Explanation, and ſometimes for a Covenant, and ſometimes for
an Exception, and ſometimes for a Reſervation; and it is taken for
a Condition; As if a man Leaſe Land, provided that the Leſſee ſhall
not Alien without the Aſſent of the Leſſor, <hi>ſub poena forisfactura,</hi> here it is a Condition; and if I have two Mannors, both of them named
<hi>Dale,</hi> and I Leaſe to you my Mannor of <hi>Dale,</hi> Provided that you ſhall have my Mannor of <hi>Dale</hi> in the Occupation of <hi>I. S.</hi> here this Proviſo is an Explanation what Mannor you ſhall have; and if a man Leaſe a

allwaies that the Leſſor is contented to find great Timber,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:110883:76"/>
here this is a Covenant; and if I Leaſe to you my Meſſuage in <hi>Dale,</hi>
provided that I will have a Chamber my ſelf, here this is an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
of the Chamber; and if I make a Leaſe rendring Rent at ſuch
a Feaſt as <hi>I. S.</hi> ſhall name, Provided that the Feaſt of St. <hi>Michael</hi> ſhall be one, here this Proviſo is taken for a Reſervation; and in our caſe,
if the words had been provided allwaies that the Donees ſhall cut
down no Trees, and the Leſſee doth Covenant he will not fell any,
here every one will agree that it is a Condition, and allſo a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant;

                  <p>The caſe is, that <hi>Simon Bulleyn</hi> being <hi>ceſtui que uſe,</hi> before 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8. Deviſed to his Wife certain Land for her life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; that after her deceaſe <hi>Robert Bulleyn</hi> his eldeſt ſonne ſhall have the land ten pound under the price it coſt,<note place="margin">Limitation.</note> and if he dyed without iſſue, that <hi>Richard Bulleyn</hi> his ſecond ſonne ſhall have the land ten pound under the price it coſt, and if he dye without iſſue of his body, then his two Daughters <hi>A.</hi> and <hi>B.</hi> ſhall have the land, paying the value thereof to the Executors of his Wife; and allſo by the ſame Will he deſired his Feoffees at the requeſt of his Wife to make Eſtates accordingly. The chief que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, and knot of the caſe is, whether <hi>Robert Bulleyn</hi> the Deviſee
hath an eſtate tayl or not; and he ſayd it ſeemed to him, he had but
an eſtate tayl: and for that we are to ſee whether the payment
ought to precede, or is ſubſequent to the eſtate; and I think
it is ſubſequent to the eſtate; For the words are, my ſonne
<hi>Robert</hi> ſhall have my laud ten pound under the price it coſt, and
ſo by the words he ought to have the land before any payment;
and I think he ſhall have the land by courſe of limitation;<note place="margin">Limitation.</note> and if he
doe not pay the money, that <hi>R. B.</hi> ſhall have the land as Heir by li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation;
<note place="margin">Crickmores caſe</note> and for that purpoſe he cited <hi>Crickmores</hi> caſe in 3 <hi>Elizab.</hi>
where a man had two Daughters, and deviſed his land to his eldeſt
daughter, paying to the youngeſt ten pound; there the eldeſt had
all the land till ſhe failed of payment of the ten pound, and then it
was adjudged that the youngeſt ſhould have the moity by way of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation.
<note place="margin">Vellock &amp; Heymonds caſe.</note> And 32 <hi>Eliz.</hi> it was adjudged in this Court <hi>inter Vellock
&amp; Heymond,</hi> where a man deviſed Burrongh Engliſh land to the eldeſt
brother, paying to the youngeſt ten pound, and after the elder failed
of payment, and the youngeſt entered by way of limitation. And in
this caſe theſe words, that <hi>Robert</hi> my ſon ſhall have my land ten
pound under the price it coſt, will make a condition, as well as if he
had ſayd, paying ten pound; and to prove that he cited Sir <hi>Edward
Cleres</hi> caſe,<note place="margin">Sir Edward Cleres caſe.</note> that theſe words upon truſt and confidence will not make
a Condition, by reaſon that the Deviſor had a ſpeciall truſt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in the Deviſee; but it is otherwiſe here, and in this caſe the
eſtate of neceſſitie ought to precede the payment; for it is appointed
that the payment ſhall be made to the Executors of the woman, and
ſo if the eſtate doe not precede the payment, then during the life of
the woman the Deviſee ſhall have no eſtate; for during her life ſhe
cannot have Executors; and ſo by conſequence can there be no pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
Allſo the words of the Will are, I deſire my Feoffees to make
an eſtate at the requeſt of my Wife, ſo that his meaning was plain,
that there ſhould be an eſtate made in the life of the Wife, for after
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:110883:77"/>
her death ſhe may not make requeſt; but it hath been ſayd, that the
ſtate ſhould be Fee ſimple, for that the words are, that he ſhall have
the land ten pound under the price it coſt, and ſo theſe words pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſhall carry the Fee ſimple: And as to that, I ſay that it ſhall not
againſt an expreſsed eſtate:<note place="margin">Expreſſed eſtate</note> And for that 2 <hi>El.</hi> 117. a Frenchman de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed
lands to his Wife for life, the remainder to <hi>C. F.</hi> and to the
heirs Males of his body, and if he dye without heirs of his body, the
remainder over, and it was taken clearly, that the generall limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
if he dyed without iſſue of his body, ſhall not alter the ſpeciall
tayl, for that the intent is apparent, and allſo he cited <hi>Claches</hi> caſe,
and <hi>Atkins</hi> caſe 34 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 33. Allſo in this caſe <hi>Robert Bulleyn</hi> the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſee
is made Executor to the woman, ſo that if it were a condition
ſubſequent, he may not make payment to himſelf, but ſhall have the
land diſcharged of the condition, by reaſon of the impoſſibility; as
if the woman had dyed inteſtat, there is no perſon to whom the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ought to be made, and ſo the Deviſee is diſcharged of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition:
Allſo in this caſe the Deviſee being eldeſt ſonne, may not
forſake the Deviſe, and take by deſcent, as in 3 <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. 46. it is for
the benefit of him in remainder; but if he might waive, he may not
waive <hi>in pais,</hi> as 13 <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. Joyntenancy is adjudged: And allſo
when he enters at the firſt, he is ſeiſed by the Deviſe, for he hath no
other right; for if he might waive, he in remainder ſhall not take.</p>

ſaid, that the reaſon in <hi>Bretts</hi> caſe 340. Com. for which land newly

                  <p>For this Will ought to be war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted
by the Statute, otherwiſe it is not good, and the Statute doth

<pb n="153" facs="tcp:110883:86"/>
Land to <hi>Henry</hi> his youngeſt Sonne when he ſhould accompliſh the

age of 24 years, then he willed that <hi>Richard</hi> his eldeſt Sonne ſhall
have the ſame Land, upon Condition, that he ſhould pay to the ſaid
Daughter 20. l. And he willed further by the ſaid Will, that if both
his Sonnes failed of payment of the ſaid 20. l. to his Daughter, that
the ſaid Land ſhould remain to his Daughter. And after this Devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor
died, and <hi>Henry</hi> his younger Son entred after the age of 24 years,

Sonne is not lawfull, and to prove that he cited a Caſe which he
ſaid was in Juſtice <hi>Dalliſont</hi> reports 9 <hi>Eliz.</hi> where a man deviſed
Land to his youngeſt Son, upon Condition of payment of a certain
ſum of money to his Daughter, as our caſe is, The Remainder over
to another of his youngeſt Sonns, and the firſt Deviſee entred, and
did not pay the money; and he in Remainder took advantage of
that, and ſo in our caſe, by the Deviſe <hi>Richard</hi> is to have nothing,
if <hi>Henry</hi> the youngeſt Son did not die before 24 yeares, and the intent
of the Deviſor appears that his Daughter ſhall have the Land for
<hi>non</hi> payment of the money; And therefore if the Heir enter for

                  <p>The Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is ſufficient, for you have delared, that you have abated
part of the debt, but you have not ſhewed how that was defaulked,
and therefore not good, for we may take iſſue upon that if we will;
and if a man be bound in an Obligation, to diſcharge me of certaine
rent, it is no plea for him to ſay, that he hath me diſcharged, without
ſhewing how; for that, that I may take iſſue upon tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the contrary,</speaker>
                  <p>And as to the firſt poiut it ſeemeth, that the diſcharge
ought to be upon the entring into bond;<note place="margin">Bond for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract.</note> for, if a man make a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
for 10. l. and after enter into bond for 5 l. parcell of that,
all the Contract is gone, as appears <hi>per 3. H.</hi> 4. And as to the ſecond

                  <p>I doubt whether the Declaration be good or not; for, it
ſeems to me that the Plaintiff ought to ſhew how he hath defaulked
the 10. l. part of the 64. l. for, it may not be intended a defaulking
in Law, but of a defaulking indeed, and for that it is not like the
caſe cited in <hi>3. H.</hi> 4. But the Plaintiff ought to doe an Act him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
And <hi>17. Eliz.</hi> A man was bound to allow, ratifie, and confirm a
term for yeers, And it is no Plea to ſay that he hath that confirmed,
But he ought to ſhew how, becauſe every Confirmation muſt be by
Deed; but if the Declaration were good, then perchance the Barre
would not be good: And howbeit that Mr. Attorney hath ſaid,
that there is a breach for not entring into Bond, yet the Plaintiff
may not ſue,<note place="margin">Every diſcharge to be by wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</note> if he have not performed his promiſe.</p>
               </sp>

                  <p>It will be hard to make the Declaration good; for, when one promiſeth
to defaulk his debt, this ſhall be intended a lawfull diſcharge, which
cannot be otherwiſe than by writing, and <hi>per 20. E.</hi> 3. Accompt.
If a man be bound to acknowledge a Statute,<note place="margin">For the intent muſt alſo be performed.</note> and he doth acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
the ſame, but yet keeps the ſame in his own hands,
this is no performance. And as to the ſecond point, when one
promiſeth, in confideration of one thing to doe another, there
ought to be performance of the firſt, as if a man be bound to
make a new Pale,<note place="margin">Diſturbance of the conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> as <hi>9. Edw. 4. 20. &amp; 15. Edw.</hi> 4. 2. 3. is, having

                  <p>There are two points in the caſe; the firſt, if by this word Aſſignee an Occupant ſhall have the land, and I think he ſhall not: And the ſecond point is
when a leaſe is made to one, and his Aſſignees, for his own life, and
the lives of two others, if now his own life confound the other two
lives, for that that it is greater to the Leſſee than the other two lives,
and he ſaid the Leſſee hath no eſtate but for his own life, and when
he dyed the ſtate is determined; and to prove that he cited the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
of <hi>Knightley</hi> in 28 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. 10. Where he ſaith if a leaſe be
made to one <hi>pur auter vie,</hi> without impeachment of Waſt, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder

for that, that when the remainder is limited unto him for his own
life,<note place="margin">Waſt againſt the ſurviving Joyntenant.</note> this drowneth the eſtate <hi>pur auter vie,</hi> which was in him before.
And by 3 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. If a leaſe be made to two for their lives without
impeachment of Waſt, and one of them purchaſe the Fee ſimple, and
dye, now his heir ſhall have Waſt againſt the Survivor. And

                  <p>I think it may never be ſaid the Land of <hi>Bedngfield</hi> onely. And to prove that he vouched 28 <hi>Hen. 8. Dyer</hi> 32. in debt for Rent, the Plaintif decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of a demiſe of 26 Acres rendring the ſaid Rent; The Defendant
pleaded that the Plaintif demiſed to him 26 Acres, and 4 Acres more,
without that that he demiſed the twenty Acres onely, And the Jury
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:110883:90"/>
found that he Leaſed but 22 Acres, and there that was good, for the
Defendant hath confeſſed a demiſe of 26 Acres, and then the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
ſhould have been, that the 4 Acres <hi>ultra</hi> were not demiſed; and
allſo he ſaid, when two men made a Feoffment, the Feoffee ſhall be in
by both, the which is a ſtrong proof, that the one ſole is not ſeiſed.</p>

after is inducted, If now the benefice which he had firſt, be void, for
that, that the qualification comes between the Admiſſion and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction.
The ſecond point is, when the diſpenſation is entred in
the Chancery in a paper book,<note place="margin">2 point.</note> and not enrolled in parchment, If this be a ſufficient enrollment, for that that the uſuall manner of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rollments is in parchment. And the third point was, when a Parſon
is inhibited by the Arch-Biſhop that he ſhall not intermeddle with
the Benefite,<note place="margin">3 point ad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>

lxxx daies, If ſuch abſence ſhall make a leaſe made by the Parſon
void. And as to the laſt point all the Judges agreed, that ſuch abſence
doth not make the leaſe void: For it muſt be a voluntary abſence,
for ſuch an abſence the Statute doth intend, and this abſence is by
reaſon of an inhibition. And the caſe was argued for the other ſide
by Mr. <hi>Crook,</hi> but I could not hear him, and the next Term it was ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued
again by Mr. <hi>Tanfield</hi> for the Plaintif, and lie ſaid that the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
point of the caſe is whether the firſt benefice be void, inſomuch
that the incumbent hath gotten a qualification before induction
into the ſecond benefice; And I think the firſt is void, for the intent
of the Statute was that the cure might be well ſerved, and that poor
people might be well relieved; And as no man may ſerve two ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
ſo no man may ſerve two Cures, and before induction the
Church is full,<note place="margin">Parſon before induction.</note> and the Parſon hath <hi>Curam Animarum,</hi> and is <hi>rector

Preſentation preſent a Clerk that is admitted and inſtituted, and

and he ſhall not preſent again.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Colchils</hi> caſe death of the preſentee before induction. 2 point.</note> And ſo it was adjudged in <hi>Colſills</hi> caſe <hi>M.</hi> 10. &amp; <hi>17. Eliz. Rot.</hi> 4. And the wordes of the Statute of <hi>22. H.</hi> 8. cap. 13. are, that every Dutcheſs, Marqueſs, Counteſs, and Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, being Widowes, may have two Chaplins, whereof every one of them may purchaſe licence or diſpenſation to receive have and
keep two benefices, with care of Souls, And before induction he <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepit,
habuit &amp; cuſtodivit</hi> two benefices, and then he was not qualli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
So the firſt was void; and as to the point of the enrollment it is
clear, there ought to be a parchment roll, for that was the meaning
of the law, and not to make an entry in the paper book. <hi>Lawton con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra,</hi>
for all the body of the act of <hi>22. H.</hi> 8. extendeth to the poſſeſſion
of the benefice, and the Proviſo ought to be conſtrued according
to the body of the act, and before induction he doth not offend the
law, and therefore the diſpenſation which comes before the indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
comes in good time, for if the Kings Tenant make a Feoffment,
and Letter of Attorney to make Livery and ſeizin,<note place="margin">Licence of alienation.</note> this is no offence,

                  <p>Before induction the firſt Benefice is not void.

Plenarty is a good plea againſt a Common perſon in ſuch a caſe; But
yet before induction he is not a full Parſon to all intents, for a grant
of an Annuity before induction is not good, <hi>Com.</hi> 526 for the inducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
makes it notorious that he is Parſon; then when he after his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:110883:92"/>
gets a qualification,<note place="margin">The Commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the fault.</note> it ſeems to me that the qualification ſhall
not help him: for the Commencement of the fault was before the
qualification, and the Induction after relates to the admiſſion, and
to prove that he cited 1 <hi>Mar.</hi> 99. where a man bought beaſts out of
the Market, and gave 5. ſ. to have election to have the refuſall in the
Market the next day, and in the Market he agreed to have the beaſts,
and paid Toll, and holden clearly that this ſhall relate to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
out of the Market (ſo in this caſe) Allſo here the words are,
ſhall take, receive, and have (after qualification) two Benefices.
And before the induction he takes the benefices, in this caſe, for before
the induction,<note place="margin">Death or depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture after qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification and taking another benefice.</note> and at the time of admiſſion, the Ordinary ſaid to
him, <hi>Accipe curam tuam &amp; meam.</hi> And if a Parſon be once qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and after take a ſecond Benefice, and then his Maſter dies, yet his
qualification remaines, ſo is it if he depart from the ſervice of his
Maſter. Then for the ſecond point for the enrollment, it ſeemeth it
is good, for that it hath been allwaies ſo uſed. For the Statute which
ſaith, a man arraigned of Treaſon ſhall be tried by people of like
condition; yet if an Eſquire be arraigned of Treaſon, he ſhall be
tried by people of meaner condition, as appears by 1 <hi>Mar.</hi> 99. for
that it hath been allwaies put in ure, and therefore ſhall be intended
that it was the meaning of the Law.</p>

                  <speaker>Fenner Contra</speaker>
                  <p>For before in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductionthe Incumbent hath no intereſt in the Parſonage, and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhoners have no notice of him, and he may not ſerve the Cure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Induction, and then if our Law do not repute him Parſon, then
the Statute doth not intend to make the firſt Benefice void, before
that he is full Parſon in another Benefice. Allſo this word (have)
in the Statute, is a word Poſſeſſory, and ought to be full to all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Popham</speaker>
                  <p>I think the diſpenſation will not help, for by the
Admiſſion as to the Cure of ſouls he is a full Parſon, and allſo ſuch a
Parſon is a ſufficient Parſon as to the Patron, and to deveſt the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
into the Parſon.<note place="margin">No laps for want of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction.</note> Allſo he is a full Parſon as to a ſtranger, for
if 7 years incurr between the Admiſſion and inſtitution before In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction,
no Laps ſhall acrew;<note place="margin">No taking of fruits before induction.</note> But as to the matter of the poſſeſſion
and fruits of the Benefice, he is not Parſon before Induction. And if
the Law no not make the firſt Benefice void in ſuch a caſe, then one
Parſon may retain 20 Benefices together, for firſt he may be admitted
into one, &amp; before Induction into that, admitted into another, <hi>&amp; ſic in
infinitum,</hi> the which was never the meaning of the makers of the Law,
and if before the Statute of 21 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. a man had taken two Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
that had not been good without a <hi>perinde valere</hi> in the ſpirituall
Law,<note place="margin">Hunting Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins.</note> and the meaning of the Law was, to help one that was a Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin
to Noble men, and not ſuch which are hunting Chaplins which
hunt after Benefices.</p>
                  <p>Then to the ſecond matter, I think the enrollment is good, and
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:110883:92"/>
but an offence in the Clerk which is finable, and not in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
for the party may not procure the Clerk to make his entry
in an another courſe than the cuſtom is, And therefore no fault in the
party.</p>
                  <p>At another day in <hi>Mich.</hi> 39 &amp; 40 <hi>Eliz.</hi> this caſe was moved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
and <hi>Cook</hi> Attorney ſeemed that the diſpenſation which comes
after Admiſſion and Inſtitution, and before Induction, comes to late,
and is not holpen by the Proviſo of the Statute of 21 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. for the
words of the Statute are, ſhall have, retein, and take a ſecond Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.
And after admiſſion and inſtitution he may not take his Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
the which he had before, for he is Parſon to make a plenarty,
and to many other purpoſes, before Induction. <hi>Gawdy</hi> ſeemed that
the admiſſion and Inſtitution made him full Incumbent, as to the
Patron and to the Parſon himſelf, But as to the poſſeſſion of the
Church he is not full Parſon before Induction, for 5 <hi>Eliz.</hi> in an iſſue
upon plenarty, it is there taken, that the Church is <hi>plena &amp; conſulta per
admiſſionem &amp; inſtitutionem</hi> before Induction. And if any other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
ſhall be made in this caſe, the Letter of the Law ſhall not
be obſerved, <hi>viz.</hi> ſhall have, receive, and keep, for he may not have
a thing the which he had before. And it ſeemes to me, that neither
by the intent nor by the Letter of the Statute it is holpen.</p>

houſes, yet that doth not extend to Biſhops, which is an higher
diginity than an Abbot, but the generall words after ought to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
with intention of other houſes inferior to thoſe named before.
So hath it been ruled, that a Leaſe by a Biſhop is out of the Statute
of 13 <hi>Eliz.</hi> cap. 10. which commenceth with Dean and Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
howbeit there are generall words after, to wit, or any
other having any Spirituall or Eccleſiaſticall living, which is
intended of any other inferior to thoſe named before, and never
was intended to extend to ſuperiors, but as I think the contrary hath
been ſince adjudged.</p>

                  <p>2. points are in the caſe. The firſt is to
whom the payment of the money, as this caſe is, ought to be made,
and I think to the Feoffee, becauſe the Heir hath nothing to do in
the land, and to prove that he cited <hi>fundamenta legum,</hi> 17. Aſſ. 2. 6. R. 2. <hi>Pleſingtons</hi> caſe, and the caſe of one <hi>Ramſey 19. Eliz.</hi> was ſuch, a man infeoffed three,<note place="margin">Ramſeys caſe</note> upon condition, that if the Feoffor paid to them or
their heires 100 l. that then he might re-enter, and after one
of the Feoffees dyed, and the Feoffor tendred the money to his
Heir, and adjudged a void tender,: And alſo <hi>Littleton</hi> proves that;
but tif the condition might be performed, to the Heirby pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that ought to be preciſely performed, for he is now
as a ſtranger, having nothing in the land, and the Covin between
the Feoffor and the Heir, muſt not hurt my Olient, for by <hi>4. E. 2. c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the intent was not performed; and <hi>20. E.</hi> 3. accompt 29. in accompt

bound to licenſe another to carrie a 100. Oakes, if he do licenſe him,
and then diſturb him, the condition is broken, and the common caſe
of Executors will prove this, for, if an Executor have but 20 l.
aſſets in his hands, and is in debt to two men, in 20. l. to either of
them; if he pay but 10 l. to the one, and have an acquittance of
him, for the whole debt of 20 l. yet the other 10. l. that remains in

                  <p>I thinke no payment ought to be made to the heir in this
caſe, no more than it ſhall be where a man is bound by obligation to
pay a leſſer ſum to the Obligee, his Heires or Executors; there
payment ſhall be to the Executor, and not to the Heir. And I think
in this caſe,<note place="margin">Conuſee by Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rute grants o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his eſtate.</note> that the payment ought to be to the Feoffee, for that
that he is to have the loſſe, for by <hi>22. E.</hi> 3. &amp; <hi>15. E.</hi> 3. if a man have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eution

and not to the Conuſee. But I am cleer in opinion, that for another
cauſe judgement ought to be given againſt the Defendant, for the
words of the condition are, <hi>ſub conditione,</hi> That if Sir <hi>John Paggin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>

ſhall be void. And I think it is no condition for livery of ſeiſin may
not be void without a re-entry, as <hi>15. H.</hi> 7. is, but for the matter of
the Covin, it ſeems to me that if the Heir may receive the money,
that ſhall not prejudice; for if he have right to have the money,
who hath any wrong, if he give part of that to another?</p>

                  <p>The payment of the money to the Heire is good; for when a man
